# 👋 Hi!

🐽 I’m @nixpig, and I'm a Senior Engineering Lead.

I've worked on frontend web for most of my career, but now exploring more of the stack and other platforms.

I'm currently working with: 

`TypeScript` • `Go` • `Rust` • `Node.js` • `React` • `React Native` • `Redis` • `PostgreSQL` • `Docker` • `Ansible` • `Azure`

You can checkout my [dotfiles](https://github.com/nixpig/dotfiles) and [playbook](https://github.com/nixpig/playbook) to build my Arch Linux and macOS dev systems.
