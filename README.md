# 👋 Hi!

🐽 I’m @nixpig, and I'm a Senior Engineering Lead.

I've focused on the front end for most of my career, but now exploring more of the stack. This is a new GitHub for a new era of my life and career. 

In my free time, I'm learning [Go](https://github.com/nixpig?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=go&sort=) and dabbling in [Rust](https://github.com/nixpig?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=rust&sort=). 

## 🗃️ Tech

`TypeScript` • `Go` • `Rust` • `Node.js` • `React` • `React Native` • `MongoDB` • `Redis` • `PostgreSQL` • `Docker` • `Ansible` • `Azure`

## 👨‍💻 Set-up

You can checkout my [dotfiles](https://github.com/nixpig/dotfiles) and [playbook](https://github.com/nixpig/playbook) to build these dev systems.

> I've just got a new MacBook Pro at work, so trying to figure out tools and a workflow that feels comfortable in that environment. Expect the above dotfiles and playbook to be updated accordingly.
