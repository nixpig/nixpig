👋 Hi, I’m @nixpig. I'm a Senior Engineering Lead. I've focused on the front end for most of my career, but now exploring more of the stack. 

🎓️ In my free time, I'm learning [Go](https://github.com/nixpig?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=go&sort=) and dabbling in [Rust](https://github.com/nixpig?tab=repositories&q=&type=&language=rust&sort=).

🐧 My dev set up consists of: 

`Arch (personal)` • `Ubuntu (work)` • `Bash` • `Terminator` • `tmux` • `Neovim` • `i3` • `Polybar`

👨‍💻 I'm currently working with the following tech at work and on personal projects: 

`TypeScript` • `Go` • `Rust` • `Node.js` • `React` • `React Native` • `MongoDB` • `Redis` • `PostgreSQL` • `Docker` • `Ansible` • `Azure`

🗃️ You can checkout my [dotfiles](https://github.com/nixpig/dotfiles) and [playbook](https://github.com/nixpig/playbook) to build my dev systems.
