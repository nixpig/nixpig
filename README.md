👋 Hi, I’m @nixpig, but you can call me **pig**. 

🧑‍💻 I'm a Senior Engineering Lead, currently leading a few teams migrating a monolith to microservices + micro-frontends. 

💻 Interested in working more on developer tooling. 

🌱 In my free time, I'm diving deeper into databases and distributed systems design.

🎬 Im considering streaming my coding sessions - idk... Twitch, YouTube, something else? Open to tips, tricks and suggestions!

💞️ I’m not currently looking to collaborate, but if you wanna chat, I have some thoughts bouncing around. 

📫 You can reach me at `[redacted]`
